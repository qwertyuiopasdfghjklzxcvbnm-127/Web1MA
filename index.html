        My website showcases 5 of the most prominent roller coasters being added to the United States in 2026. 
        These are all confirmed and announced roller coasters, which means there may be more prominent roller coasters being added to amusement parks around the country,
         but they haven't been announced yet so they aren't included. The five roller coasters I showcased were Circuit Breaker and Palindrome at Cotaland,
         Fast and Furious Hollywood Drift at Universal Studios Hollywood, Quantum Accelerator at Six Flags New England, and Tormenta Rampaging Run at Six Flags Over Texas.
